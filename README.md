### Hi there, I'm Hannah 🐺 

I graduated from Rutgers University with a BFA in Acting, and after spending several years performing in and directing theatrical shows, I picked up coding as a hobby--partially on a whim, partially because my sister told me she thought I'd enjoy it. Almost immediately, I found myself diving headfirst into personal Python projects, SQL database schemas, and data munging. Recently, I completed my first batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I focused on Python/Pandas, distributed systems, and data visualizations.

- 💻 Let's talk about Python, SQL, and R. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about statistics and resilliance engineering.
- 👯 I’m looking for work as a **junior data engineer or data analyst**.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: Otters hold hands while sleeping so as not to float away from each other. 🦦
